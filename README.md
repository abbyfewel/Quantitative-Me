# Quantitative-Me
#### Abby Fewel CPSC 222 Spring 2025 Project 1

## Description of Project:
I tracked my study habits and the amount of assignments I completed this semester by day, week, and class. I also used data within my 4-year plan to make predictions about workload for my future semesters at Gonzaga once I digested the data of the work I did this semester.

## How to Run the Project: 
My project can be run by cloning this repository and running the Jupyter Notebook `QuantitativeMe.ipynb`. This will use the many `.csv` files in the repo and will output data visualizations, hypothesis tests, and classification results.

## How the Project is Organized:
The project is organized into `.csv` files for data: `data.csv`, `daily_data.csv`, `classes_transposed.csv`, and `class_totals.csv`. Overall data is merged together in `Data Log.xlsx`, which contains data organized by week, class, and type. Code is all done in `utils.py` and called from `QuantitativeMe.ipynb`, where `.png` outputs are shown and saved.
